== Image Server

This is a very simple Web server implementing an API which when queried for the last image from a category will query the database and return an HTML Tag that will be used in an iframe in the Grafana dashboard. The API implements two different formats for the images. +

For example, when queried for `/last_image_small/<bucket_name>`, the server returns:

[source,html,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
<img src="<storage_url>/<bucket_name>/<image_name>" style="width:260px;"></img>
----

I told you, nothing terrific here...

=== Creation

Have a look at the file, and apply it:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 09_dc-image-server.yaml
----

=== Verification

In the Console, navigate to Workloads->Pods, and wait for the pod `image-server-xxxxx` to be in the Running state.
