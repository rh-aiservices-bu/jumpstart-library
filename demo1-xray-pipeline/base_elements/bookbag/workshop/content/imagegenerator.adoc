== Image Generator

Of course, we won't _generate_ XRay images for this demo. +
Instead, this component will copy randomly chosen source XRay images hosted in a public AWS bucket (around 600 images) to our Ceph incoming bucket. +

The generator features an environment variable, called `seconds_wait`, that sets a waiting time between every images. +
And when you set this parameter to 0, which is the initial state, our process stays idle! That's our on/off button to launch and stop the demo.

=== Creation

Have a look at the file, and apply it:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 12_dc-image-generator.yaml
----

=== Verification

In the Console, navigate to Workloads->Pods, and wait for the pod `image-generator-xxxxx` to be in the Running state.
