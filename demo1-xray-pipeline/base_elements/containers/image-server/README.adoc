= Image server

This container image is used to display the last image uploaded into a bucket, according to the helper database.
It implements a webserver with a REST API that you can query like this: +
`http(s)://<webserver.address>/last_image_small/<bucket_name>` +
or +
`http(s)://<webserver.address>/last_image_big/<bucket_name>` +
depending on the size of the image you want. + 

It will return something like: +
`<img src="<service_point>/<bucket_name>/<image_name>" style="width:260px;"></img>` +
that you can embed in a web page (in the case of this lab a Grafana dashboard).

Required environment variables are: +
*Object storage*

* `service_point`: S3 storage endpoint, http(s)://myendpoint.address

*Helper database*

* `db_user`: database user name
* `db_password`: database password
* `db_host`: database host
