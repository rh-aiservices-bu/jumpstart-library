= Demo 3 - Industrial condition based monitoring with ML

This “AI/ML Industrial Edge” demo shows how  condition based monitoring can be implemented using AI/ML. Machine inference-based anomaly detection on metric time-series sensor data at the edge, with a central data lake and ML model retraining. It also shows how hybrid deployments (cluster at the edge and in the cloud) can be managed, and how the CI/CD pipelines and Model Training/Execution flows can be implemented.

This demo is using OpenShift, ACM, AMQ Streams, OpenDataHub, and other products from Red Hat’s portfolio

This is the frontend at the factory:
